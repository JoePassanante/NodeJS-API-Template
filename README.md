# NodeJS-API-Template
Barebones NodeJS - Express Server to demonstrate handling API requests and connecting to a mongoDB server. 

## Getting Started
Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your computer. You can find a proper download link [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download the full current version. 

## Working with NPM
In order to download the needed packages to run this, navigate to the root folder of this project and run `npm install`. This will automatically install all the packages located in package.json

## Running the server
In the root folder from console run `node index.js` and this will start the program.

The entry point for nodejs apps is typically `index.js` or `server.js`. Depends on the developer. 

### Suggestion
Download `nodemon` which automatically restarts the node server when you make changes. The default `node` command does not refresh when you make changes, making testing tedious. You can download nodemon by running `npm i -g nodemon` this installs it globally so you can use it in any other nodejs project!

## Notes
Please review code, as there will be comments explaining how everything works.
